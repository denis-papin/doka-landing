    <h2>How the Idea of Doka Was Born</h2>
    <p>
      Doka started with frustration. I was constantly forwarding myself emails, digging through
      attachments, misplacing PDFs, and saving duplicates across my cloud storage. There was no
      single place where everything just... clicked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of clarity came during a routine task ‚Äî looking for a contract buried in a long
      thread. It wasn‚Äôt the first time, but this time something shifted.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <em>
        ‚ÄúWhat if we stopped treating email like a one-time communication tool and instead used it as
        a living archive ‚Äî a knowledge hub?‚Äù
      </em>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Reimagining Email and Document Convergence</h2>
    <p>
      Think of all the information locked inside your inbox: invoices, identity papers, travel
      documents, receipts, scanned forms. It‚Äôs a treasure trove ‚Äî but hidden behind a dated
      interface and a terrible search function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doka doesn‚Äôt reinvent email. It reinterprets it. It extracts, links, and elevates your
      documents so they work for you ‚Äî not against you.
    </p>

    <h2>The Emotional Value</h2>
    <p>
      The true power of Doka isn‚Äôt just document retrieval. It‚Äôs mental clarity. No more asking
      ‚ÄúWhere did I save that?‚Äù No more digging through attachments. No more forgetting what you
      already have.
    </p>
    <p>Doka gives you a sense of control in a world drowning in digital noise.</p>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Doka isn‚Äôt just launching a product. It‚Äôs starting a movement: a privacy-first, open-source
      approach to personal knowledge. An inbox that works for you. A system that grows smarter with
      every interaction ‚Äî without selling your data.
